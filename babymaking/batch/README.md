### So you want to make some babies?

I know this guy -- great guy -- the best. He uses condor to deliver his babies instead of storks.
This is what he does
```bash
# Edit four_top.py with samples you want and tag near the bottom
# Edit ducks.py to build instructions with appropriate samples
# Open up a screen before proceeding
# Get environment
cd NtupleTools/AutoTwopler/
. setup.sh
cd ../../
# Submit
python ducks.py
```
